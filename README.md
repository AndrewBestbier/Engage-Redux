#Engage

###What is Engage?
Engage is an online web-application that allows student's to join virtual online rooms created by their teachers. Students can ask questions completely anonymously in these rooms - thereby allowing the shyer student's to have a voice. Students can also vote on their peers questions and respond to polls created by their teachers.

###Why I rebuilt Engage

I rebuilt Engage to demonstrate my current level of ability. This is the fourth time I have rewritten Engage in the last year - each time to benchmark myself. The various iterations were as follows:

* November 2014: Javascript, Jquery, Firebase
* March 2015: AngularJs, Firebase
* July 2015: ReactJs, ES5, Firebase
* November 2015: ReactJS, ES6, Redux, Node, Express, MongoDb, SocketIO, TDD, CI

As you can see above, I used Firebase to provide authentication and real-time communication for the first three iterations.
 
I decided for this current iteration that I would develop Engage full-stack. I also decided to practise proper development practises, namely Test-Driven-Development and Continuous Integration. I plan to maintain this current iteration.
